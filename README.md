# trying_flutter
I already have experience using GitHub because I started using it when I was in Grade 11 i use GitHub to store and manage my programming projects. I know how to upload files using git add, git commit, and git push. GitHub helped me understand the concept of version control. I can track my progress through the commit history i have also experienced editing and updating projects in a repository because of GitHub, I became more organized with my files. My early experience with GitHub has been very helpful in my IT journey. Currently i am using a second GitHub account because I lost access to my main account due to forgetting the password and losing access to the email associated with it.
